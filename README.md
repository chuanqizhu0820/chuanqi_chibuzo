Steps to Merge Branches to main branch
- Create a repository on GitHub
- Clone the repo
- Create a branch and switch to it
- Work on the branch 
- Add & commit on the branch
- Run this: git push origin <branch name> ( for every modification).
- The other partner switches to his branch and then pulls the branch using git pull origin <branch name>.
- He works on his own branch, and repeats the process of add and commit and push.
- Once the job is done, switch to the main branch and merge the most updated branch into the main branch.
- Run git push to update the main branch in the remote (I.e. GitHub)
